# Random Dog Photo Generator

Welcome to the Random Dog Photo Generator iOS app! This simple app is built using Swift and Xcode, allowing users to generate random dog photos with just a click of a button. Whether you're a dog lover or just in need of a cute distraction, this app is perfect for you.

This app is the developer's first ever attempt at making an iOS app in Swift and Xcode. The program files contain multiple layers, the majority of which are commonly generated code for iOS use and are provided by Xcode. The viewController contains the functional code that is unique to this app. 

It contains a ViewController class which nests all of the functions and modules of this program. There is a view screen, which contains the generated image, as well as a button which were both rendered unto the main screen. Both are styalized for placement, color, and size. 

The main functions of this program include getRandomPhoto(), didTapButton(), and viewDidLoad(). The first function pulls the url code of a randomly generated photo from "placedog.net", which is a site that hosts a collection of dog photos. This site provides a url with a query to generate a dog photo with each refresh. The second function, didTapButton() utilizes the website's feature by calling for a random dog photo with each tap of the button. Lastly, viewDidLoad() renders the visual display upon loading the app.
